# Welcome to Simon!

This is a project where you will build the game Simon using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a good place to start learning about HTML and JavaScript, or a good place to refresh your knowledge if you have forgotten some of it! After this, you can decide to learn more advanced HTML (maybe working towards your White Belt) or JavaScript (which will allow you to build games and apps).

## What is Simon?

Simon is a trick game of memory. The computer flashes boxes of colour on the screen and then you have to click the boxes in the same order. It starts off easy when the computer only flashes a few boxes, but it gets harder when the computer is flashing lots of boxes one after the other!

## Step 0: Get an editor and get the files

To program Simon you will need a computer (an iPad won't work, sorry!), a text-editor (we use Atom), a web browser (we use Google Chrome) and some files to start us off. Some of you may have Atom and Google Chrome on your computer already, so you can skip ahead to the "Get the files" section below.

### Get Google Chrome

If you don't have Google Chrome, you can download it by going to [https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) and clicking the "Download Chrome" button and then the "Accept and Install" button on the box that pops up. A file should start downloading. When it is finished, double-click on it to install Chrome.

### Get Atom

If you don't have Atom, you can download it by going to [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/) and clicking the red "Download" button. A file should start downloading. When it is finished, double-click to install Atom.

### Get the files

If you are looking at this page on GitHub (at [https://github.com/gar/simon](https://github.com/gar/simon)) you should see a "Download ZIP" button up at the top-right. Right-click on that link and select "Save link as...". Choose to save the file on your desktop. A file called "simon-master.zip" should start downloading.

When it is finished, double-click on it and you should have a folder called "simon-master" on your Desktop. We will be doing all our coding for Simon in this folder, so let's open it in Atom.

Open Atom and then click "File" and "Open...". Find the "simon-master" folder on your Desktop, then find the "My Code" folder inside there. Click on "My Code" and then click "Open".

You are now ready to start coding Simon!
